If anybody wants Admin role then send your email to me. I will assign Admin role for testing and even for successful connection with database you have to get a env file(Contact me and I will share the key).

# Setting up environment

1. Firstly clone this whole repo and then you can contact me for .env file.
2. I will give you a .env file that you have to place in backend/ directory.
3. For setting up frontend follow the readme.md by Gatsby starter template in this repo client folder.
4. For setting up backend just install necessary packages using npm install
5. After setting up both frontend and backend, run backend first using 'node index' or 'nodemon index' and then frontend using npm start or gatsby develop.
6. Note that if server isn't running then frontend will give error(at the time of development only due to gatsby). So make sure that backend is running without any errors like files related
